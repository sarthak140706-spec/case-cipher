# Case Cipher – Forensic Case Management System

## Project Overview
Case Cipher is a web-based forensic data management system designed to manage criminal cases, evidence records, suspects, officers, and investigation reports in a secure and structured way.  
The system helps investigators store, retrieve, and analyze case-related information efficiently using a database-driven approach.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of Database Management System (DBMS) concepts such as relational data storage, CRUD operations, authentication, and structured data handling.
